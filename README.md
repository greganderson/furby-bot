# furby-bot
A friendly chatbot that tries to help you solve problems by patiently listening to what you have to say.

Back when I took CS 3500 at the University of Utah, my professor, Dr. H. James de St. Germain told us about his Furby.  He's got a Furby in his office that he talks to when he has challenging problems.  In talking out his problems, he often times will find the solution.  I've been wanting to have something like that at work, but I can't just start talking to a stuffed animal, not until I have my own private office ;)  But I found myself asking questions over chat to my teammates, and would find the solutions, just like Jim.  So I made my own chatbot that will act like my own personal Furby.
